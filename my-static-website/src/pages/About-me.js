            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, sports have been a central part of my life since I could walk—practically receiving a pair of cleats as my first shoes. Throughout my life, I’ve played football, lacrosse, and wrestled. I discovered rugby during my senior year of high school and decided to pursue it in college, choosing this path over football.

                Another important aspect of my life is my faith. I am a born Christian and a strong believer, and my faith has instilled in me values and morals that guide how I live. These principles influence not only my personal life but also my professional endeavors, with my core values being honesty, loyalty, and hard work.

                Water and being at the lake are also integral parts of my life. Growing up, I spent countless summers boating and tubing at my family’s cabin, creating memories that shaped my love for the outdoors. Now, I take every chance I get to visit Lake Superior for a cold plunge—a refreshing recovery ritual that blends my passion for fitness and the calming power of nature.
