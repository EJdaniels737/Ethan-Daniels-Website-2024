            <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Ethan Daniels, and this is my personal website. 
                Some of my hobbies include staying active through rugby and weightlifting. 
                I currently play rugby at UMD and have been involved in sports for as long as I can remember. 
                Participating in team sports from a young age sparked my passion for weightlifting, which remains 
                a significant part of my life. While I primarily lift to enhance my athletic performance, weightlifting 
                has become much more than just trainingâ€”it's a personal passion.
            </p>
